# Installation

## Stable release

To install metamaska, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install metamaska
```

This is the preferred method to install metamaska, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.
